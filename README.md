MultiComplex Matlab Class and Associated Files

This is a matlab class to allow multicomplex numbers to be used for a range of functions. It accompanies the ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software paper titled "Algorithm xxxx: Multicomplex number class for Matlab, with a focus on the accurate calculation of small imaginary terms for multicomplex step sensitivity calculations". A pre-print version of which an be found in this repository.
