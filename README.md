# MultiComplex
MultiComplex Matlab Class and Associated Files

This is a Matlab class to allow multicomplex numbers to be used for a range of functions. It accompanies the ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software paper titled "Algorithm 1008: Multicomplex number class for Matlab, with a focus on the accurate calculation of small imaginary terms for multicomplex step sensitivity calculations". A pre-print version of which can be found in this repository. The DOI is 10.1145/3378542.

Improvements were made to the multicomplex class by Chung Chung To and Leo Bugeja as part of their final year projects which included matrixless operations for improved performance and additional utility functions.
